# Getting started with SageMathCloud

## Lecturers - Sign up for an account

Basic usage of SageMathCloud is free but before you can start using it, you need to create an account. This can be done at https://cloud.sagemath.com/

It is strongly suggested that you, and your students, sign up using your institutional email addresses.
This makes it much easier to find students in the system.

## Getting your students to sign up

You don't need to worry about getting accounts for your students ahead of time.

Once you've created your course in SageMathCloud, you just a add list of student email addresses to it. All students immediately get sent a course invite, and when they create an account with that address, they are good to go.
