# Getting started with SageMathCloud

## Sign up for an account

Basic usage of SageMathCloud is free but before you can start using it, you need to create an account. This can be done at https://cloud.sagemath.com/

It is strongly suggested that you, and your students, sign up using your institutional email addresses.
This makes it much easier to find your students in the system.


## Bulk account creation

CAN THIS BE DONE? USEFUL FOR LARGE CLASSES. NEED TO CHECK WITH SMC TEAM
