Notes for an introduction to Jupyter notebooks and Sage Math Cloud for lecturers.

There isn't much here yet! Probably best to come back soon!

## Jupyter Notebooks

Lorem ipsum.....

## SageMathCloud

[SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) is a cloud based service that provides infrastructure and services that are useful for running courses based on Jupyter Notebooks.
It is used for [teaching by Universities around the world](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching) and the University of Sheffield has used it for several of its undergraduate courses. We will be using for even more courses in the 2016/17 academic year.

Basic access, without internet access, is free but it is well-worth paying for premium access if you are going to support a class full of students or need internet access.
Paying users get more resources and support - vital if you are to rely on it for paying students.

## Some Benefits of SageMathCloud

* No installation or configuration necessary. Everything Just Works.
* Students can use it on any machine, any operating system, anywhere they like.
* Has built in course-management functionality.
* Allows collaborative editing of notebooks. (It's like Google Docs for Jupyter notebooks)

## Course material

* Section 1 - Overview of what you can *easily* do in SMC?
* Section 2 - What can't you do in SMC?
* Section 3 - Creating a course full of students
* Section 4 - Assignments
* Section 5 - Costs
