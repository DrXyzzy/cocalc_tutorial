Through this hands on tutorial you will learn to:

- Set up a course and create the main directories

- Use GitHub to populate your course (as well as version control)

- Add collaborators and students

- Assign, collect, and mark coursework

- Use various means to interact with students and collaborators

## Pre-requisites
