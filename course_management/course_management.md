# Course management

No matter what you've added in the instructors view of the course, the students will not see any files until you explictly assign them.

## Folder structure

I prefer to group course material together in folders. For example, the folder **Week_1** may contain the following files

* Lecture1.ipynb 
* Assignment1.ipynb
* somedata.csv
