  <h1 id="interacting-with-students-and-collaborators">Interacting with students and collaborators</h1>
<p>There are multiple ways in which you can interact with your students or collaborators, in this section we will present some features that you might find useful when managing a course.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-chatrooms">Real-time chatrooms</h2>
<p>You can create general real-time chatrooms for your SMC projects. You can create a project chat room by clicking on the <strong>New</strong> button, this will create a file with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sage-chat</code> extension.</p>

<p>In addition, every file in SMC has a separate chat that can be found on the upper left corner of your screen.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/chat_button.png" alt="The chat button" /></p>

<p>Every time one of your students writes something into a chat on any one of their files, you will get a notification displayed on the top bar.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/instructor_notification.png" alt="The notification" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the notification button (bell icon on the top of the screen) displays a notification menu with the latest chats and modifications in the project or specific files.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/notification_highlighted.png" alt="Notification Bar" /></p>

<p>The chat notifications are always presented at the top of the menu, followed by any updates you or your collaborators have done to the project. Clicking on a chat notification will take you to <strong>the student’s copy</strong> of the file inside <strong>his/her project</strong>.
From there, you can both reply to their questions and look at their work simultaneously.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/student_question.png" alt="TA assistance example" /></p>

<p>Once you have replied to the student’s question (s)he will receive a notification.</p>

<h2 id="live-collaborative-editing">Live collaborative editing</h2>
<p>Multiple users can collaborate on a project. As soon as a collaborator is added to a a project (see <a href="./creating_a_course/creating_course.md">Creating a Course</a>) they share both the project and the associated files.</p>

<p>Live collaborative editing is possible in SMC. If one of your collaborators updates a notebook, the rest can see the changes as they are being made (similar to Google Docs).</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-shared-project">Creating a shared project</h2>
<p>You can create a common shared project from any of your existing projects. You can think of a shared project to be your private course website for the students with automatic forum and code support. By default everybody (collaborators and students) will have <strong>write</strong> access to the project and its associated files.</p>

<p>To create a shared project you need to go to your <strong>.course</strong> file and click on the <strong>Shared ‘Project</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/shared1.png" alt="Create shared" /></p>

<p>If you create a <strong>.sage-chat</strong> file here, all students will receive automatic notifications when questions are posted on the chat.</p>

<p>If you want to make a file or an assignment <strong>read only</strong> so that students cannot modify it you need to modify the file permissions. Launch a terminal and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod a-w filename</code> (in this example the filename is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assignment1</code>).</p>

<p><img src="./assets/read_only.png" alt="Read only files" /></p>

<p>If you want to check the access permissions of all the files contained in a given directory use the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls -l</code> on the terminal.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/ls_assignment.png" alt="Access check" /></p>

<p>In the case you want to change a read only file into a read and write type <code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod a+w filename</code> on the terminal.</p>

<h2 id="group-projects">Group Projects</h2>
<p>There are various ways in which you can facilitate  students group projects in SMC. A couple of options are:</p>

<h3 id="one-project-per-team">One project per team</h3>
<p>Have someone on each group make a project with all the group members as collaborators.
They will all then be able to collaborate on the same project and modify files simultaneously.</p>

<p>You should note, however, that by using the approach you cannot automatically collect assignments from the team. However, a workaround could be creating an assignment in your main project and have the students copy the file over to their group project.</p>

<h3 id="using-git">Using Git</h3>
<p>Students can collaborate in their own course-affiliation using git via the terminal in SMC (for more tips on using git see the Interesting features and tricks section).</p>
