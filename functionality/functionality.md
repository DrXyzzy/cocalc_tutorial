# A tour of SageMathCloud

SageMathCloud contains a lot of functionality. In this section, we'll take a look at what it can do

### Create your first project

Log into SageMathCloud and click on the **projects** icon in the top left hand corner of the screen.

Click on **Create New Project**, fill out the **Title** and **Description** and click on **Create Project**

Once you've created it, click on the project title to open it. It will initially be empty so we'll start creating files

### Linux terminal

SageMathCloud provides full access to the Linux terminal. To open a terminal, click on **New** and give your session a name. I've used `terminal session` in the example. Click on **>_ Terminal** to begin your session
