# A tour of SageMathCloud

SageMathCloud contains a lot of functionality including the ability to run Linux terminals, Jupyter Notebooks and Sage Worksheets along with a wide range of course management facilities. 

In this section, we'll take a closer look at some of the features not related to course management. Course management features are described elsewhere in this session.

### Create your first project

Log into SageMathCloud and click on the **projects** icon in the top left hand corner of the screen.

Click on **Create New Project**, fill out the **Title** and **Description** and click on **Create Project**

Once you've created it, click on the project title to open it. It will initially be empty so we'll start creating files

### Linux terminal

SageMathCloud provides full access to the Linux terminal. To open a terminal, click on **New** and give your session a name. I've used `terminal session` in the example. Click on **>_ Terminal** to begin your session

This starts up a traditional looking Bash session
