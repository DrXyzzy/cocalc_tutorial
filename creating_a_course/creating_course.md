# Creating a new course

We will learn how to create a course project, how to populate it with a course management file and how to invite all of your students to join the course

## Creating the course project

In this section we are going to create a project containing a course.

Log into SageMathCloud and click on the **projects** icon in the top left hand corner of the screen.

Click on **Create New Project**, fill out the **Title** and **Description** and click on **Create Project**

The new project will appear at the top of the project list. Click on its  title to open it.

##Â Creating the course file

Once you've opened the course project, you need to create a course management file.

Click on **New** and give the course a title. Here, I've used `Autumn_2016_PHY001`. Click on **Manage a Course** to create the course file.

If you go to the root of the course project directory, you will see that a new file has been created with the extension **.project**. This is the course management file and all aspects of your course are controlled by it.

## Adding students to the course

Open your course by clicking on the **.course** file.

In the **Students** tab, add a comma separated list of students in the search box and click on the search icon.

Highlight all of the students in the resulting list and click on **Add N Students** where N is the number of students in your list.

All added students will be invited to join your course by email. Any student who does not have an account on SageMathCloud will be invited to create one.

Your course page will now look like this

* Email addresses that are followed by **(invited)** do not have a SageMathCloud account yet. **(invited)** will disappear as soon as they sign up.
* You can see when each student last used the course project. In this case -- never!
* The **! Free** warning next to each student shows that they are running this course on free servers. It is **strongly** recommended that you upgrade this to members-only servers for your students.
