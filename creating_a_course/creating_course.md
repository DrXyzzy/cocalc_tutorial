# Course Management #1

## Creating the course project

In this section we are going to create a project containing a course.

Log into SageMathCloud and click on the **projects** icon in the top left hand corner of the screen.

Click on **Create New Project**, fill out the **Title** and **Description** and click on **Create Project**

![Create new course project](./assets/create_new_course_project.png )

The new project will appear at the top of the project list. Click on its  title to open it.

##Â Creating the course file

Once you've opened the course project, you need to create a course management file.

Click on **New** and give the course a title. Here, I've used `Autumn_2016_PHY001`. Click on **Manage a Course** to create the course file.

## Adding students to the course

In the **Students** tab, add a comma separated list of students in the search box and click on the search icon.

![Student list](./assets/student_list.png)

Highlight all of the students in the resulting list and click on **Add N Students** where N is the number of students in your list.

All added students will be invited to join your course by email. Any student who does not have an account on SageMathCloud will be invited to create one.

Your course page will now look like this

* Email addresses that are followed by **(invited)** do not have a SageMathCloud account yet. **(invited** will disappear as soon as they sign up.
* You can see when each student last used the course project
* The **! Free** warning next to each student shows that they are running this course on free servers. It is **strongly** recommended that you upgrade this to members-only servers for your students.

## Exercise idea

Split the class into groups. Mimium size 3 per group.
Get one person to be the instructor -- the other 2+ people, the students.

* Provide example lecture notesbook for them to use.
* Provide example assignment notebook for them to use.

Exercise proceeds by lecturer distributing the materials to the students.

Students work through the lecture notebook and completes the assignment.
Lecturer monitors and comments using the collaborative notebook tools

Lecturer marks the assignment and returns them to students
